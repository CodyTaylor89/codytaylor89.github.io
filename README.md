# Cody Taylor's Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio website, showcasing my journey in software development as I work towards becoming a full-stack developer. Here, you'll find projects that demonstrate my growing skills and knowledge across different technologies.

## About Me
Hi there! I'm Cody, a self-taught software developer on a journey to become a full-stack developer. I'm passionate about learning new technologies, solving problems, and building creative solutions. I have a foundational knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and other programming languages, and I'm constantly expanding my skill set.

This portfolio is a way for me to document my progress, showcase my projects, and share my enthusiasm for software development. Thanks for stopping by!

## Features
- **Projects**: A showcase of my coding projects, including links to live demos and GitHub repositories. Each project highlights different aspects of what I'm learning, from front-end design to back-end logic.
- **About Me**: Learn more about my background, interests, and journey in software development.
- **Contact Information**: Information on how to get in touch with me, including email and links to my profiles.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5** and **CSS** for building the structure and styling the website.
- **JavaScript** for adding interactivity on the front end.
- **Node.js** for server-side scripting.
- **Express.js** to create the server and manage routing.
- **MongoDB** for database management, using a NoSQL approach.
- **React** (in future projects) for building dynamic user interfaces.
- **GitHub Pages** for hosting the portfolio and showcasing live projects.

As I continue my journey, I am focusing on building my skillset with technologies that cover both front-end and back-end development.
